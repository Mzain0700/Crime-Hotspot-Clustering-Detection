# Chicago Crime Hotspot Detection and Time Series Prediction

This repository contains a data analysis and machine learning project focused on **identifying crime hotspots** and **predicting future crime trends** using Chicago dataset. Using historical crime data, the project applies clustering, time series analysis, and predictive modeling to provide actionable insights into crime patterns.

The final output is a set of **JSON files** containing information on identified hotspots and their predicted future crime rates, designed for integration.

## üöÄ Project Goals
- **Data Analysis**: Understand historical crime patterns and distribution in Chicago.  
- **Hotspot Detection**: Use clustering to group crime incidents into geographical hotspots.  
- **Time Series Forecasting**: Predict the number of future crime incidents within each hotspot.  
- **Model Integration**: Prepare results in JSON format for front-end/mobile applications.

## üìä Dataset
The analysis is based on the comprehensive **"Crimes - 2001 to Present"** dataset provided by the City of Chicago. The Dataset Size is Approximately **82.73 lacs Rows** from 2001-2025.
This dataset includes detailed records of reported criminal incidents from **2001 to the present**, with information on **location, crime type, date, and time**.

## üõ† Methodology

### 1. Data Preprocessing and Exploration
- **Loading and Cleaning**: Convert date/time, remove missing coordinates.  
- **Feature Engineering**: Create time-based features (year, month, day, weekday).  
- **Aggregation**: Monthly counts for time series; spatial grouping for clustering.  

### 2. Clustering for Hotspot Detection
Three clustering algorithms were explored:  
- **K-Means**: Iterated with different *k* values to find optimal clusters.  
- **DBSCAN**: Density-based clustering, good for irregular hotspot shapes.    

### 3. Time Series Forecasting
- For each hotspot, monthly crime counts were modeled.  
- Models used:  
  - **sktime** library (multiple forecasting algorithms).  
  - **Prophet** (by Facebook), ideal for seasonality and trend-based crime prediction.  

### 4. Hotspot Prediction with XGBoost
- A **supervised learning model (XGBoost)** was trained to unify predictions.  
- Final output includes **risk scores and future predictions per hotspot**.

## üìç Clustering and Hotspot Identification
- Crime hotspots were detected with clustering methods.  
- Each hotspot includes **central coordinates** and **dominant crime types**.  
- Visualizations highlight **high-density areas of crime activity**.  

---

## üìà Predictive Model Results
Final outputs are exported as JSON files, including:  
- **Hotspot ID** and **coordinates**.  
- **Primary crime types** per hotspot.  
- **Predicted number of crimes for the next 30 days**.
